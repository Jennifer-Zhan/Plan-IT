# Plan.IT

Plan.IT is an AMP stack productivity app that assists users in organizing the tasks that they need to accomplish. To make doing tasks easier, the site will recomend to the user which task they should do based on the tasks properties. The site also allows the user to easily add new tasks as well as update the completion of current tasks and set tasks as complete. The stats tab allows the user to view how they are currently doing. They can look at their stats or the earth image that changes mood based on how well the user has kept with their tasks.
